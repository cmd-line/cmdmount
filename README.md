# cmdmount
A different spin on openpilot magnetic mounts, inspired by [Tunder Mag Mount](https://github.com/Tundergit/mag-mount-fast)

## Source files now included so you may modify to your heart's content

Soon to come are heatsinks and a PCB to send power to the fan with USB C.

## This mount is for the Leeco Le Pro x720 or similar sizes (73.9 mm x 151.4 mm x 7.5 mm)

This mount was created because, while I like other quick-remove mounts that people have designed, I wanted one that was low profile and would be completely out of sight. So the cmdmount uses a 60mm fan which fits nicely behind a Leeco x720.

Also, NOTE - The version shown is the **60mm version**, I have not printed the 80mm version but it is there if anybody wants it.

Some people have said that the magnet can cause interference with the fan's operation. I have not encountered this, but try orienting your magnets before securing them permanently. You may need to flip their poles.
